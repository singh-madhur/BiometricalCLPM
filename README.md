**Abstract**

**Background**: Smoking and depression often co-occur in young adults, potentially due to reciprocal causal effects and/or shared underlying etiological factors. Here, we tested causal hypotheses between smoking quantity (cigarettes per day; _CigDay_) and depressive symptoms (_DepSx_) using novel Biometrical Cross-Lagged Panel Models (CLPMs), which integrate twin developmental and direction-of-causation analyses for more robust causal inference in longitudinal twin studies.

**Methods**: Study sample included 10,034 participants (61.6% females; 4,112 twin pairs) from the Twins Early Development Study, with up to six repeated assessments spanning ages 21–29. The Biometrical CLPM provided three key innovations over standard twin CLPM: distinct autoregressive processes of latent genetic and environmental factors; cross-lagged genetic and environmental liabilities, contrasting confounding and causation; and cross-sectional causal effects, distinguishing between proximal (short-term) and distal (lagged) causation. 

**Results**: In the two largest waves assessed approximately four years apart, genetic liabilities for both variables remained highly stable, while environmental influences showed considerable temporal variation. In the standard CLPM, _CigDay_ predicted _DepSx_ four years later. However, in the Biometrical CLPM, the cross-lagged phenotypic associations were attenuated and non-significant when accounting for the differential genetic and environmental developmental processes. Adding the cross-sectional causal paths revealed significant bidirectional proximal effects, with a stronger _CigDay→DepSx_ effect. Across all six waves with intervals up to two years, analyses consistently showed significant bidirectional cross-lagged associations. 

**Conclusions**: The findings support a reinforcing feedback loop between _CigDay_ and _DepSx_ during young adulthood, involving bidirectional effects that persist for up to two years but dissipate over longer intervals.
